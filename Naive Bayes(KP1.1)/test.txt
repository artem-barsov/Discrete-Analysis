A peninsula (Latin: paeninsula from paene 'almost' and insula 'island') is a landform surrounded by water on most of its border while being connected to a mainland from which it extends.
The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not
necessarily named as a single body of water. Peninsulas are not always named as
such; one can also be referred to as a headland, cape, island promontory, bill,
point, fork, or spit. A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land
projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. A river
which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a
"peninsula" within the (almost closed) loop of water. In English, the plural
versions of peninsula are peninsulas and, less commonly, peninsulae.

According to Net Applications, which tracked the use of operating systems in devices that are active on the Web, Windows was the most used operating-system family on personal computers in April 2020, with around 88% usage share.
Including personal computers of all kinds (e.g., desktops, laptops, mobile
devices, and game consoles), Windows OSes accounted for 35.84% of usage share in
May 2020, compared to Android (highest, at 37.48%), iOS's 15.52%, and macOS's
8.61%, according to StatCounter, which tracks use of operating systems by their
use in devices active on the Web. Windows is used in less than half the market,
not only in developing countries, but also in developed ones – such as the
United States, where use of Windows on desktops, on which it is the plurality
operating system, has fallen to 61% in Dec. 2020, compared to 31% for macOS
while for personal computers of all kinds Windows's share is down to 29.66%,
less than iOS (meaning iPhones and iPadOS for iPads]]s) at 31.43%. It must be
noted, that servers (including so-called cloud computing, while Microsoft is
known not to be a leader; and also uses Linux more than Windows) is not counted
in the statistics (and iOS has no such use), as StatCounter uses web browsing as
a proxy for all use. Use of the latest version Windows 10 has exceeded Windows 7
globally since early 2018.

Jews, or Jewish people, are members of an ethnoreligious group and a nation originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah
Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the
second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel.
The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel
somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). The
Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold
with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Some consider that these
Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as
'Hebrews'. Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail, the
experience of diaspora life, from the Babylonian captivity and exile to the
Roman occupation and exile, and the historical relations between Jews and their
homeland thereafter, became a major feature of Jewish history, identity and
memory.

Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time.
Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of
astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics,
chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural
philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these
natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.
Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as
biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly
defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied
by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines
such as mathematics and philosophy.

Taekwondo, Tae Kwon Do or Taekwon-Do is a Korean martial art, characterized by punching and kicking techniques, with emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques.
The literal translation for tae kwon do is "kicking," "punching," and "the art
or way of." It is a martial art that attacks or defends with hands and feet
anytime, anywhere without any weapons, and the purpose of physical training is
important, but it also has great significance in fostering the right mind
through mental armament. Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform, known as a
dobok. It is a combat sport and was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by
Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese
martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyon,
Subak, and Gwonbeop. The oldest governing body for Taekwondo is the Korea
Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by
representatives from the nine original kwans, or martial arts schools, in Korea.
The main international organisational bodies for Taekwondo today are the
International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), founded by Choi Hong Hi in 1966, and
the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World
Taekwondo Federation or WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea
Taekwondo Association. Gyeorugi ([kjʌɾuɡi]), a type of full-contact sparring,
has been an Olympic event since 2000. The governing body for Taekwondo in the
Olympics and Paralympics is World Taekwondo.

Borscht is a beet soup of Ukrainian origin common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.
It is typically made using a large amount of beets (originally, sour
beets), by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed or boiled vegetables, which
may include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the
recipe, borscht may vastly vary in thickness (from porridge-like thick to
drink-like smooth). A pot of borscht, however, may be cooked with meat, or with
its bouillon or neither.

Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.
It is the world's largest religion, with about 2.4 billion followers. Its
adherents, known as Christians, make up a majority of the population in 157
countries and territories, and believe that Jesus is the Christ, whose coming as
the Messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, called the Old Testament in
Christianity, and chronicled in the New Testament. Christianity remains
culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, as well as in its
doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology,
ordination, and Christology. The creeds of various Christian denominations
generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who
ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the
salvation of mankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news".
Describing Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John, with the Old Testament as the gospel's respected background
